## Features and Interfaces

I'm currently making some final changes to the web app and will soon update this document with the latest demo images of the web app.

1. Home Page <a id="home"> </a>

    - [Landing Page](https://example.com/) which lists all the features of the app

2. Login Page (Authentication) <a id="auth"> </a>

    - Fast and secure authentication
    - JWT tokens used to persist the authentication state

3. Dashboard <a id="dashboard"> </a>

    - Shows bried information about all the exams assigned to the user

    - The user can start an exam only at the correct timeslot

4. Exam Page <a id="exam"> </a>

    - Simple and minimalistic exam page where the user can answer MCQ-based questions

    - The user can view and track their progress>

5. AI-powered face motion detector <a id="face"> </a>

    - I've used Google's Mediapipe library to track the motion of the user's face

    - This app can check if a user is trying to cheat by monitoring the co-ordinates of their face

    - The face detection is performed on-device without sending anything to the backend

    - Thus, Face detection is fast and real-time
